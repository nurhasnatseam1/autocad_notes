2.SELECT WALL LAYER AND CREATE PLOT RECTANGLE USING DETERMINED DIMENSION FOR EXAMPLE (60,50)
3.TAKE OFFSET USING (offset) TO CREATE THE OUTER WALL . 
4. USE TRIM OR FILLET(0) TO MAKE OUTER WALL OFFSET THE SPECEFIED AMOUNT.

5.COLOR THE PLOT LINES .





6.TO CREATE INER BOUNDARY OF THE WALL

	EXTERNAL_WALL WIDTH 9"
	INTERNAL PARTITION WALL 6" OR 4"


7. AFTER THE THE CREATION OF ALL WALL HAS BEEN DONE . DO THE DOORS

	DOOR FOR 
		W.C & BATH 2'6" x 7' (width x height but not weight)
		BEDROOM  3' X 7'
		MAIN DOOR 4' OR 5'x7'

	1.FIRST CREATE THE DOOR OPENING  *MAIN DOOR 5/4' * BEDROOM 3' *BATH/W.C 2'.6"

8.AFTER CREATING DOOR OPENING CREATE WINDOWS ON ITS OWN LAYER
	Windows
		3' x 4'
		4' x 4'
		5' x 4'
		For kitchen
		5' x 3'
		Ventilators 
		2' x 2'
		2' x 2'6"

	you have to create winows as a block .the block will have CHAJJA AND WINDOW aligned with each other.

	STEPS:   in the windows layer
		1.create rectangle for your target window size . For now (width x height x weight)(4'x4'x9"(exterior wall)) or
			(5'x4'x9") or(5' x 4' x 3') 
		2. create a divider line to separate the windoew vertically .
		3. create 2 line on separate sides of the divider taking offset 6"
		4. go to the CHAJJA layer
		5. take 6" offset using line from a corner of the window. from offset point create vertical line of 1'6" .create a horizontal line 
		to the other corner+6" point. and finish the CHAJJA.
		6.create a block including both window and CHAJJA AND NAME IS 'WINDOW'
		7.insert another 2 of those windows. 
		8.stretch them horizontally to create (5'x 4'x9") or (6'x4'x9")
		9.select all of them .
		9.rotate and mirror them to position them according to the angle of the wall.
		10.copy and paste windows to the target wall.

9.CREATE STAIRS.
	MAIN STAIRS.
		STAIRS LAYER  (6'6" X 11'4")
		1.CREATE LANDING OF AT LEAST 3' WITH (OFFSET).
		2.CREATE 10 RAIGERS BY TAKING OFFSET OF 10" FROM ONE ANOTHER.
		3.DEVIDE THE STAIRS BY THE MIDDLE.
		4.TAKE OFFSET OF MEASURED DISTANCE FROM THE DIVIDER TO SEPARATE THE TWO LAYERS OF THE STAIR.
		5. ADD THE SYMBOL TO THE LOWER LAYER.
		6.HIGHLIGHT THE UPPER LAYER WITH HIDDEN LINE TYPE.(LAYER THAT RESULTS IN LANDING)(NOT THE ON THAT GOES OUTSIDE OF THE LANDING) 
		6.
	STAIRS OF BARANDA:(5'X 9')
		1.MAKE A RECTANGLE OF WIDTH 5' AND HEIGHT OF BARANDA DOOR LENGTH WITH LINES.THAT WOULD BE THE LANDING.
		2.FROM LANDING TAKE OFFSET OF 1' AND CREATE THREE RANGERS.
		3.CREATE HANDLING BY OFFSETTING 2" FROM THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF STAIRS AND LANDING.
	ANOTHER WOULD BE (4'X 30")
			3 RAIGERS.


10.CREATE DOORS AND FILL THE DOOR OPENING CREATED ABOVE
	1.CREATE RECTANGLE OF (2"X3')
	2.ADD HANDLE TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE DOOR.
	3.FROM INTERSECTION POINT OF BOTH OUTER POINT OF DOOR HANDLE AND LOWER LEFT CORNER OF DOOR.CREATE A LINE OF 3'.
	4.USEING THE LINE AS  RADIUS CREATE A CIRCLE
	5.TRIM THE PORTION OF THE CIRCLE WHICH IS NOT NEEDED.
	6.NOW CREATE A BLOCK WITH THE DOOR NAMED "DOOR_BASIC"

	7.USING MIRROR CREATE DOUBLE DOOR.
	8.ROTATE AND MIRROR AS NEEDED AND CREATE COPIES OF THAT DOOR IN ALL FORMATION THAT'S NEEDED.
	9.PLACE THE DOOR IN PLACE.
	10.IF YOU NEED A SMALLER DOOR IN SOME PLACES THEN SCALE THE DOORS AS NEEDED.

ELEVATION :

GO TO THE WALL LAYER.
** CREATE PROJECTION OF GROUND FLOOR.**
