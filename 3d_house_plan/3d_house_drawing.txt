	10.UNION ALL THE WALLS.
	11.POSITION THE UNIFIED WALL ON TOP OF BOX.

5.CREATE 3D WINDOWS (SIMPLE WINDOW , SLIDER WINDOW,)
		SIMPLE WINDOW = (FRAME AND GLASS), frame = 1",glass = .4"
		SLIDER WINDOW ={ IF ANY WOODEN FRAME ON WALL(WALL OUTSIDE .8")} -> WINDOW FRAME(2") -> FRAME OF GLASS(.8") ->GLASS(.4")
	1.USE THE ELEVATION DRAWING TO CREATE WINDOW,DOOR,VENTILATORS WITH THE APPROPRIATE SIZE.

	2.ROTATE THE WINDOW TO MATCH THE REQUIRED ANGLE OF IT.
	3.SELECT THE MIDPOINT AND COPY AND POSITION IT TO THE TARGET WALL LOCATION.(MIDPOINT).
6.CREATE ANY FRAMES THAT'S OUTSIDE THE WALL.
7.CREATE STAIR HEAD.
8.CREATE PRAPET WALL IF ANY. OR CREATE RAILING.
	RAILING ON BARANDA.
		1.CREATE AN OFFSET OF 9" FROM THE OUTER WALL.
		2.COPY THAT LINE AND MOVE IT ALONG THE Z AXIS 3' UPWARD.
		3.USE DYNAMICS UCS.
		4.CREATE A CIRCLE OF 2" RADIUS USING THE ENDPOINT OF THE  UPPER LINE AS BASE FOR THE CIRCLE.
		5.USING SWEEP CREATE A ROUNDED PIPE ALONG THE LINE.
		6.USING THE LINE BELOW AND USING THE TECHNIQUE ABOVE CREATE PIPES OF RADIUS 1".
		7.CREATE 5 OF THEM OR AS MANY AS YOU LIKE.
		8.SELECT THE LINE BELOW AND EXTRUDE IT UPWARD TO CREATE A SURFACE OF 2 '.
		9.CREATE THE STANDING PIPES FOR THE RAILINGS.
	PARAPET AND RAILING:
		CREATE A PARAPET OF 2'
		THEN ON TOP OF THAT CREATE RIALING.
		1.CREATE AN OFFSET OF 9".
		2.USING PRESSPULL EXTRUDE THAT UPWARD FOR 2'.
		3.CREATE A LINE AT THE MIDDLE OF THE PARAPET WALL.
		4.USING THAT LINE CREATE THE RAILING OF 1.5'.
 9.CREATE THE STAIR HEAD.
		1.CREATE THE STAIR HAED OF 8'.
		2.IF THERE IS ANY WINDOW ANY WINDOW. DO THIS.
			DRAW BOX INSIDE THE STAIR HEAD USING THAT PARTICULAR DIMENSION.
			THEN SUBSTRUCT THAT BOX FROM THE STAIR HEAD.
			DRAW A LINE AT THE MIDDLE OF THE CUTOUT WALL.
			USING THAT LINE CREATE A SURFACE USING EXTRUDDE.
10.CREATE A SWIMMING POOL AT THE TOP OF THE ROOF.
		1.CREATE A RECTANGLE USING BIGGER HALF OF THE ROOF.
		2.EXTRUDE IT FOR 5 FEET.
		3.CREATE SHAPE OF RECTANGULAR CORNORS ON TOP OF THAT BOX.
		5.COPY THAT SHAPE TO SOME ANOTHER PLACE.
		6.USING FILLET MAKE THAT SHAPE INTO A DULL ONE.
		9.TAKE AN OFFSET OF 9".
		10.SELECTING THE INNER BOUNDED AREAD OF THE LINES CREATE A EXTRUDED AREA OF 4 FEET.
		11.COPY THE TWO LINES AND THAKE TO SOME OTHER PLACE.
		12.MAKE TWO COPIES OF THEM.
		13.SELECTING THE OUTER BOUNDARY EXTRUDE  AN AREA OF 4 FEET DOWNWARD.THIS WILL BE USED TO CREATE THE  CUT OUT 
                   FROM THE BOX.
		14.FROM THE OTHER COPY , SELECT THE INNER SHAPE. EXTRUDE THAT AREA 3.5 FEET DOWNWARD. THIS WILL BE USED AS THE WATER.
		15. NOW MAKE THE CUTOUT USEING THE BIGGER SOLID. PLACE IT ON THE BOX SITTING ON ROOF USING THE SHAPE DRAWN BEFORE.
		16.PLACE THE WATER INSIDE THE POOL.MAKE THEN A GROUP.
		17.PLACE THE GROUP ON TOP OF THE CUTOUT.
11.CREAE CHAJJA OF 1.5" HEIGHT.
12.CREATE MAIN STAIRS.
	RAIGERS HEIGHT 6".
	DEPENDING ON THE (HEIGHT OF THE WALL+PLINTH HEIGHT+ROOF WEIGHT) CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF HEIGHER ALONG THE Y AXIS.
	CALCULATE THE WIDTH OF THE RAIGER PLATE USING THE (HORIZONTAL LENGTH OF THE STAIRS-LANDING LENGTH)

	1.CREATE A BOX OF (RIGER PLATE WIDTH x PLATE LENGTH x PLATE HEIGHT)
	2.CREATE A LINE OF 4" ON TOP RIGHT CORNOR OF THE PLATE THAT GOES INWARD.
	3.USING THE INNER ENDPOINT OF THAT LINE CREATE COPIES OF THE RIGERS HORIZONTALLY.
	4.FROM THE LAST COPI OF THE RIGER USE PRESSPULL TO EXTRUDE A PLATE OF LENGHT = LANDING LENGTH.
	6.NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE A 90 DEGREE TURN.
	7.CREATE RISER OF PROPER AMOUNT ACCORDING TO THE HIGHT OF THE UPPER PORTION OF THE STAIR.
	9.CREATE LANDING FOR THE STAIR AT THAT HEIGHT.(REMOVE THE STAIR FROM THAT PLACE THEN USE PRESSPULL ON IT).
	10.CREATE RAILING USING 3D_PLINE .
		TURN OFF DYNAMIC UCS.
		TURN ON OBJCT SNAP.
		CREATE THE 3D LINE USING REFERENCE POINTS FOR THE RAILING.
		CREATE PIPE OF 2" AND 1".
		
13.ADD MATERIALS TO THE OBJECTS.
	1.VISUAL STYLE TO "REALISTIC"
	2.GO TO MATERIALS PALATE USING "MAT" COMMAND.
		MATERIALS: (DRAG AND DROP)
			1.WALLS,FLOORS,STAIRS CASE,COLUMNS ->WALL PAINT (COOL WHITE)
			2.FRONT WALL CAN BE STONE 
			3.CHAJJAS TO GREEN.
			4.WINDOW AND DOOR FRME TO WOODEN. OR ALUMINIUM.
			5.GLASS TO GLASS
			6.MAKE ALL THE RAILINGS AND BALLIGS UNIONED SENCTIONWISE. AND USE MATERIAL ON THAT.(METAL >SHARPEN STEEL)
